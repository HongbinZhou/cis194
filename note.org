1. 如果一个type constructor要是Functor的instance，那它的kind必须是* -> *.
2. fmap:
   - a function that takes a function and a functor and then maps that function over the functor
   - or as a function that takes a function and lifts that function so that it operates on functors.
3. fmap ::   (a->b) -> f a -> f b
   <*>  :: f (a->b) -> f a -> f b
